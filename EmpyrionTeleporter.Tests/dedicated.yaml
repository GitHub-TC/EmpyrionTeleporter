### Dedicated server settings
### To use your own dedicated.yaml (e.g., "MyDedicatedConfig.yaml"), add "-dedicated MyDedicatedConfig.yaml" to the corresponding batch file

ServerConfig:
    Srv_Port: 30000
    Srv_Name: My Server
    # Srv_Password: Abc

    ### Server description shown in Server Browser
    ### max 127 chars: "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    ### Set the following parameter to false (or comment the line out) if you want to hide your server in the Server Browser 
    ### If server is not visible you can connect via IP or via joining a friend's game.
    Srv_Public: true
    
    ### All playfield servers will be automatically stopped every <n> real time hours. Players will get some warning messages before
    # Srv_StopPeriod: 48

    ### Activate Telnet server
    # Tel_Enabled: true   
    # Tel_Port: 30004

    EACActive: true

    ### Location of save game folder    
    # SaveDirectory: Saves

    ### Restrict allowed Blueprint size class: restricted types are not allowed to be produced or spawned
    # 1 = allow only small blueprints, ... , 10 = allow very large blueprints, ..., 50 = allow gigantic blueprints, ... , 0 = no limits
    ### Warning: large blueprints can have very strong performance impact!
    MaxAllowedSizeClass: 10

    ### Restrict Blueprint types allowed for production in factory
    ### None      = Blueprint system completely disabled
    ### StockOnly = only stock blueprints can be produced
    ### All       = all types allowed (default)
    AllowedBlueprints: All

    ### Timeout in seconds after which a playfield server process will be killed (and all players on it disconnected) if it does no longer send heartbeat messages to the dedi 
    ### Set 0 to disable this feature
    HeartbeatServer: 15

    ### Timeout in seconds after which a client will be disconnected if it does no longer send heartbeat messages to the dedi
    ### Set 0 to disable this feature
    # HeartbeatClient: 30

    ### Enable extra log outputs (for debugging purposes)
    ### Defined flags: (add together the values if more than one group should be active at the same time)
    ### 1 = EAC
    ### 2 = EAC_all_details (includes EAC - Note: this generates a lot of log lines)
    # LogFlags: 2

    ### Uncomment the following line if you want to prohibit Steam Family Sharers playing (only the game owner can then play)
    # DisableSteamFamilySharing: True

    ### Players with a ping higher than the value specified below will be locked out of the game. We recommend to not allow too high pings as this can result in player cheating
    # KickPlayerWithPing: 300

    ### Monitors booting playfield server processes, kills them if they time out (time in seconds, 0 = disabled)
    ### Note: This is a conservative default, for faster servers 60 seconds should be ok
    TimeoutBootingPfServer: 90
